      <i>Leveraging GitOps has allowed us to create a self-service platform for engineers so they can concentrate on delivering business value through innovation, without the full need for Platform Team assistance. The engineers focus on building container images and managing the testing of their microservices and Weave Flux handles the deployments.</i>
