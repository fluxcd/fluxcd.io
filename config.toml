summary = """
Flux is a tool that automatically ensures that the state of your [Kubernetes](https://kubernetes.io) cluster matches the configuration you've supplied in Git. It uses an [operator](https://github.com/operator-framework/awesome-operators) in the cluster to trigger deployments *inside* Kubernetes, which means that you don't need a separate continuous delivery tool.
ðŸ“£ Flux is in maintenance mode and the we will soon guide the community to migrate from Flux v1 to the new architecture (Flux v2 and the GitOps Toolkit). [Learn more](https://toolkit.fluxcd.io/) and [join the discussion!](https://github.com/fluxcd/toolkit/discussions)
"""

workflow = """
Flux monitors all of the container image repositories that you specify. It detects new images, triggers deployments, and automatically updates the desired running configuration of your Kubernetes clusterâ€”and does so within the bounds of a configurable deployment policy.

With Flux, everything is controlled through pull requests, which means no learning curve for new developers. Just use your standard PR process.
